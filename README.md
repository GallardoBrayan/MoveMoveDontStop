HackUCI Motion Capture WebApp
This project was done at the UCI Hacakathon, HackUCI, along with 4 other students. The purpose of the web application is to make users more
active. This is accomplished by playing music ONLY when a user moves in front of their webcam.It is a JavaScript heavy project. A good 
portion of the JavaScript code is borrowed from a public motion detection JavaScript library.
